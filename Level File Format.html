<br><b><font size="+3">Syntax of the COS426 Scene File Format</font></b> <br>
<hr width="99%" size="3">


<p>For this project we define a rudimentary scene graph language. Each command 
begins with keyword and goes on until the next command or until the end of the 
file is reached. Commands may extend across new-line characters, lines starting 
with the hash character # will be ignored as comments.  All numbers
are assumed to be floating point.  Angles are given in radians.</p>

<p>Most of the commands are the same as in assignment #3. 
There are only five new commands (particle, particle_source, and particle_sink, 
particle_spring, and particle_gravity), as described below. 

</p><p>In general, positions and distances should be in meters, times in seconds, and weights in kilograms.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------>

<br>&nbsp;<br></p><hr>
<p><b>particle</b> 
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; position_x position_y position_z</b> 
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; velocity_x velocity_y velocity_z</b> 
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mass fixed drag elasticity lifetime mat_id</b> 

</p><p>This command defines a particle with initial position
<i>(position_x,position_y,position_z)</i> and initial velocity
<i>(velocity_x,velocity_y,velocity_z)</i>.  

</p><p>The last six values specify the <i>mass</i> of the particle (range:
0 to <i>infinity</i>), whether or not the particle has a fixed position
(range: 0=freetomove or 1=fixed), the <i><a name="#drag">drag</a></i> coefficient of the
particle (range: 0 to <i> infinity</i>), the <i>elasticity</i> of the particle
(range: 0 to 1), the <i>lifetime</i> of the particle (in seconds from
its creation, or &lt;=0 to live forever), and the material ID for the
particle, an index into the list of <i>materials</i> previously
defined within the same file.  If <i>mat_id = -1</i>, then no material
is assigned immediately, and the surface will either adopt the
material specified with an enclosing <i>begin</i> and <i>end</i>
commands or a default material (gray) if there are no enclosing
<i>begin</i> and <i>end</i> commands.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------>

<br>&nbsp;<br></p><hr>
<p><b>particle_source</b> 
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mass fixed drag elasticity lifetime mat_id</b> 
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rate velocity angle_cutoff</b> 
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; source_shape</b>

</p><p>This command defines a particle source, a generator of particles.  The 
source should generate <i>rate</i> particles per second with initial positions 
randomly distributed on the surface of the source.

</p><p>The surface of the source is specified by the <i>source_shape</i> parameters, 
which appear in one of the following formats:
</p><pre>   line    x1 y1 z1  x2 y2 z2  
   box     low_x low_y low_z  high_x high_y high_z
   circle  center_x center_y center_z  normal_x normal_y normal_z radius 
   sphere  center_x center_y center_z  radius
   mesh    meshname
</pre>

<p>These shape descriptions are similar to the ones used for creating
scene elements.  Specifically, if the source shape is a line, then six
values appear after the "line" keyword to specify the two endpoints of
the line segment: <i>(x1,y1,z1)</i> and <i>(x2,y2,z2)</i>.  If the
source shape is a box, then six values appear after the "box" keyword
to specify the "low" corner of the box <i>(low_x,low_y,low_z)</i> and
the "high" corner of the box <i>(high_x,high_y,high_z)</i> (e.g., a
unit cube is "box -1 -1 -1 1 1 1"). If the source shape is a circle,
then seven values appear after the "circle" keyword to specify its
center <i>(center_x,center_y,center_z)</i>, its normal direction
<i>(normal_x,normal_y,normal_z)</i>, and its <i>radius</i> (e.g., a
unit circle in the xz-plane is "circle 0 0 0 0 1 0 1").  If the source
shape is a sphere, then four values appear after the "sphere" keyword
to specify its center <i>(center_x,center_y,center_z)</i> and
<i>radius</i> (e.g., a unit sphere is "sphere 0 0 0 1").  Finally, if
the source shape is a mesh, then one parameter follows the "mesh"
keyword to specify the mesh filename (e.g., "mesh teapot.off").

</p><p>When a particle is generated with this source, it should have an
initial velocity vector with magnitude equal to <i>velocity</i> and
with a direction equal to the normal of the surface (or line) at the
particle's initial position perturbed by a random angle between zero
and <i>angle_cutoff</i>.

</p><p>The particle should be generated with the given <i>mass</i> (range:
0 to <i>infinity</i>), fixed status (range: 0=freetomove or 1=fixed), 
drag coefficient (range: 0 to <i>infinity</i>), elasticity (range:
0 to 1), liftime (in seconds from their creation, or &lt;=0 to live
forever), material ID (<i>mat_id</i> is an index into previous defined
materials), where all these parameters are interpreted in the same way
as described in the particle command.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------>

<br>&nbsp;<br></p><hr>
<p><b>particle_sink</b> 
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; intensity ca la qa</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sink_shape</b>

</p><p>This command defines a particle sink, an attactor or repulsor of
particles.  The sink attracts particles towards (or away from) the
sink surface and kills them if they intersect its surface.

</p><p>The sink surface is specified by the <i>sink_shape</i>,
which has the same format and interpretation as described for 
particle sources. 

</p><p>If the <i>intensity</i> of the particle sink is non-zero, then
the sink exerts a force on particles.  The direction of the force is along the
vector from the particle to the closest point on the surface.
The magnitude is equal to
<i>intensity</i>*<i>1.0/</i> (<i>ca </i>+ <i>la*d</i> +
<i>qa*d*d</i>), where <i>d</i> is the distance from a particle to the
closest point on the sink shape's surface, and <i>ca, la, </i>and
<i>qa </i> define the constant, linear and quadratic components of the
attenuation factor. Note that the specified
<i>intensity</i> can be negative (to repel particles).

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------>

<br>&nbsp;<br></p><hr>
<p><b>particle_spring</b> 
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; particle1 particle2</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rest_length ks kd</b>

</p><p>This command defines a "spring" between two particles with the given
<i>rest_length</i>, spring coefficient <i>(ks)</i>, and damping_coefficient<i>(kd)</i>.
This pair of particles should apply a force upon each other according to
Hooke's Law.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------>

<br>&nbsp;<br></p><hr>
<p><b>particle_gravity</b> 
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; vx vy vz</b>

</p><p>This command defines the vector of acceleration due to gravity.  
For earth, you can use (0, -9.80665, 0), assuming that Y is "up."

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------>

<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br></p><hr><hr>
The following commands define the non-particle elements of the scene -- 
they follow the syntax of assignment #3 without change.
<br><hr><hr>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------>

<br>&nbsp;<br><hr>
<p><b>box</b> 
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mat_id </b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; low_x low_y low_z</b> 
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; high_x high_y high_z</b> 
</p><p>This command defines an axis-aligned box with corners <i>(low_x,low_y,low_z)</i> and 
<i>(high_x,high_y,high_z)</i>, where <i>high_x&gt;low_x, high_y&gt;low_y, and high_z&gt;low_z</i>.  
</p><p>The box will have the material indicated by <i>mat_id</i>,
an index into the list of <i>materials</i> previously defined within the same file.
If <i>mat_id = -1</i>, then no material is assigned immediately, and the surface
will either adopt the material specified with an enclosing <i>begin</i> and <i>end</i>
commands or a default material (gray) if there are no enclosing <i>begin</i> and 
<i>end</i> commands.

<br>&nbsp;<br></p><hr>
<p><b>cone</b> 
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mat_id </b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; center_x center_y center_z</b> 
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; radius height</b> 
</p><p>This command defines a cone, with a central axis parallel to the y-axis, and 
centered at the point (<i>center_x,center_y,center_z</i>). The radius and height are given 
by <i>radius</i> and <i>height</i>, respectively. The cone is a closed surface 
(i.e. it has an end cap on the lower-y-side, and an apex on the higher-y-side). 
The base lies at y=center_y-height/2 and the apex lies at y=center_y+height/2. 
</p><p>The cone will have the material indicated by <i>mat_id</i>,
an index into the list of <i>materials</i> previously defined within the same file.
If <i>mat_id = -1</i>, then no material is assigned immediately, and the surface
will either adopt the material specified with an enclosing <i>begin</i> and <i>end</i>
commands or a default material (gray) if there are no enclosing <i>begin</i> and 
<i>end</i> commands.

<br>&nbsp;<br></p><hr>
<p><b>cylinder</b>

<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; center_x center_y center_z</b> 
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; radius height</b> 
</p><p>This command defines a cylinder, with a central axis parallel to the y-axis, and 
centered at the point (<i>center_x,center_y,center_z</i>). The radius and height are given 
by <i>radius</i> and <i>height</i>, respectively. The cylinder is a closed surface 
(i.e. it has end caps.). The ends lie at y=center_y-height/2 and y=center_y+height/2. 
</p><p>The cylinder will have the material indicated by <i>mat_id</i>,
an index into the list of <i>materials</i> previously defined within the same file.
If <i>mat_id = -1</i>, then no material is assigned immediately, and the surface
will either adopt the material specified with an enclosing <i>begin</i> and <i>end</i>

<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mat_id </b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x1 y1 z1</b> 
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x2 y2 z2</b> 
</p><p>This command defines a line segment with endpoints <i>(x1, y1, z1)</i> and 
<i>(x2, y2, z2)</i>.  You do not have to intersect lines in your ray tracer,
since they are infinitely thin.  This command is provided mainly for visualization 
purposes (the lines will be drawn in rayview).
</p><p>The line segment will have the material indicated by <i>mat_id</i>,
an index into the list of <i>materials</i> previously defined within the same file.
If <i>mat_id = -1</i>, then no material is assigned immediately, and the line segment
will either adopt the material specified with an enclosing <i>begin</i> and <i>end</i>
commands or a default material (gray) if there are no enclosing <i>begin</i> and 
<i>end</i> commands.  

<br>&nbsp;<br></p><hr>
<p><b>mesh</b> 
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mat_id </b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; meshname </b>
</p><p>This command includes a mesh into the scene.  The file with name <i>meshname</i>
is opened (.off, .ray, or .obj), and all the triangles of that file are read 
and added to the scene graph. 
</p><p>The mesh will have the material indicated by <i>mat_id</i>, 
an index into the list of <i>materials</i> previously defined within the same file.
If <i>mat_id = -1</i>, then no material is assigned immediately, and the surface
will either adopt the material specified with an enclosing <i>begin</i> and <i>end</i>
commands or a default material (gray) if there are no enclosing <i>begin</i> and 
<i>end</i> commands.

<br>&nbsp;<br></p><hr>
<p><b>sphere</b> 
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mat_id </b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; center_x center_y center_z</b> 
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; radius</b> 
</p><p>This command defines a sphere with the specified center <i>(center_x,center_y,center_z)</i> and 
<i>radius</i>.  
</p><p>The sphere will have the material indicated by <i>mat_id</i>,
an index into the list of <i>materials</i> previously defined within the same file.
If <i>mat_id = -1</i>, then no material is assigned immediately, and the surface
will either adopt the material specified with an enclosing <i>begin</i> and <i>end</i>
commands or a default material (gray) if there are no enclosing <i>begin</i> and 
<i>end</i> commands.

<br>&nbsp;<br></p><hr>
<p><b>tri</b> 
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mat_id </b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x1 y1 z1</b> 
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x2 y2 z2</b> 
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x3 y3 z3</b> 
</p><p>This command defines a triangle with coordinates <i>(x1,y1,z1)</i>, 
<i>(x2,y2,z2)</i>, and <i>(x3,y3,z3)</i>.  
</p><p>The triangle will have the material indicated by <i>mat_id</i>,
an index into the list of <i>materials</i> previously defined within the same file.
If <i>mat_id = -1</i>, then no material is assigned immediately, and the surface
will either adopt the material specified with an enclosing <i>begin</i> and <i>end</i>
commands or a default material (gray) if there are no enclosing <i>begin</i> and 
<i>end</i> commands.

<br>&nbsp;<br></p><hr>
<p><b>begin</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mat_id</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; m11 m21 m31 m41</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; m12 m22 m32 m42</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; m13 m23 m33 m43</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; m14 m24 m34 m44</b>
&nbsp;<br>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ... commands ...</b>
&nbsp;<br>
<br><b>end</b>
</p><p>This pair of commands defines a node that will be added to the current
scene-graph with the specified material and transformation context.
All geometric primitives within the <i>begin</i> .. and associated <i>end</i> command
are subject to the 4x4 transformation matrix given in the <i>begin</i> command,
and any such geometric primitive that does not already have a material assigned
(i.e., its <i>mat_id</i> was -1) will adopt the material indicated by <i>mat_id</i>
(where <i>mat_id</i> is the index of a material in the same file).
</p><p>Groups may be nested, permitting the specification of a transformation
heirarchy.&nbsp; Shapes within nested groups are subject, in order, to the
transformation contexts of all their enclosing groups.&nbsp; The total
transformation context of a given shape is determined, then, by starting with
the matrix of the root enclosing group, and concatenating additional matrices on
the right as we decend into nested groups, until we reach the geometric primitives.
The transformation context of a group is applicable only to its shapes and sub
groups, so we must remove matrices from the right as we ascend back up the
heirarchy.
</p><p>The matrix elements appear as follows and are intended to operate on column
vectors:
</p><p><tt>|m11 m21 m31 m41|</tt>
<br><tt>|m12 m22 m32 m42|</tt>
<br><tt>|m13 m23 m33 m43|</tt>
<br><tt>|m14 m24 m34 m44|</tt>
</p><p>Note: When the .ray file is initially parsed the root scene-graph node is
instantiated with the identity matrix, so that geometric primitives may be specified
in world coordinates outside the context of any <i>begin</i> and <i>end</i> pair.

<p><b>material</b> 
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ka_r ka_g ka_b</b>

<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e_r e_g e_b</b> 
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; n &nbsp; ir &nbsp; texturename</b> 
</p><p>This command defines a material. 
The first material declared will take the interger identifier 
<i>0</i>, and subsequent materials will follow in order (i.e. <i>1, 2, 3</i>, 
...). This integer handle is used in geometric commands later in the file
to assign reflectance properties to surfaces.  Note that materials have file
scope.  So, the material indices will not be affected by <i>include</i> commands.
</p><p><i>(ka_r,ka_g,ka_b)</i>, <i>(kd_r,kd_g,kd_b)</i>, and <i>(ks_r,ks_g,ks_b)</i> are the RGB 
coefficients of ambient, diffuse, and specular specular reflectance, <i>(kt_r,kt_g,kt_b)</i> 
are the coefficient of transparency (where 0 is fully opaque and 1 is fully transparent), and 
<i>(e_r,e_g,e_b)</i> is the emissive color of the material (e.g., if a
geometric primitive is a light source). With the exception of the distributed ray
tracing task, emissive surfaces do not actually contribute
illumination to other surfaces, but, unlike the explicit light
sources, they are directly visible in the camera and in reflections
etc.
</p><p>The exponent n defines the specular 'shininess' of the material, and takes 
non-negative values where <i>0.0</i> is not shiny at all and <i>100.0</i> is very shiny. 
The cosine of the angle between the ray direction and the specular reflection 
direction raised to the power of n gives the specular highlight factor. 
</p><p>The index of refraction is given by <i>ir</i> and is used in Snell's 
Law computations for refraction direction. For non-closed surfaces, 
such as triangles, it is assumed that <i>ir</i> is the index of refraction 
on the backside of the surface. For closed surfaces, such as cones, it is 
assumed that <i>ir</i> is the index of refraction on the inside of the surface. 
</p><p>To assign a texture to this material, <i>texturename</i> should be the
name of an image file, and texture coordinate should be generated for primitives.
At rendering time, the diffuse color kd will be modulated by the color of the corresponding texture pixel . If no texture is to be associated with the material, then a value of <i>0</i> must be given
for <i>texturename</i>.

<br>&nbsp;<br></p><hr>
<p><b>ambient</b> 
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; r g b</b>
</p><p>This command defines the color of ambient light for the scene.  For a 
ray tracer, it specifies the RGB color that should be added to every illumination
calculation (in addition to the contributions determined for diffuse and specular
reflections from dir_lights, point_lights, and spot_lights. Do not compute ambient 
contributions from each light, but rather use the color provided by this
command for the single, global ambient light source.

<br>&nbsp;<br></p><hr>
<p><b>area_light</b> 
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; r g b</b> 
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; px py pz</b> 
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dx dy dz</b> 
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; radius</b> 
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ca la qa</b> 
</p><p>This command defines a light with a planar, circular area in the scene.&nbsp;  
<i>(r,g,b)</i> gives the color of the light.
<i>(px,py,pz)</i> gives the center of the circular area in world coordinates.
<i>(px,py,pz)</i> and <i>(dx,dy,dz)</i> define the plane on which the area light resides,
and <i>radius</i> defines extent of the area on the plane (i.e., the radius of the circle).
Use this type of light to demonstrate soft shadows.
</p><p>The attenuation of the light with distance from its position is given by <i>ca, 
la, </i>and <i>qa </i>which define the constant, linear and quadratic components 
of the attenuation factor. If <i>d</i> is the distance from the light to 
the surface, and <i>thera</i> is the angle between the light direction and the
direction to the surface, then the light's color at the surface is given by (<i>r,g,b</i>) 
*<i>cos(theta)/</i> (<i>ca </i>+ <i>la*d</i> + <i>qa*d*d</i>). Each coeficient 
must be non-negative. Note: to achieve no attenuation use a 
<i>(ca,la,qa)</i> of (<i>1.0,0.0,0.0</i>). 
</p><p>If no light sources
appear in the file, default ones will be provided by the parser (two directional
light sources).  Otherwise, every light source must 
appear before any <i>begin</i> commands in the file.  


<br>&nbsp;<br></p><hr>
<p><b>dir_light</b> 
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; r g b</b> 
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dx dy dz</b> 
</p><p>This command defines a directional light in the scene.&nbsp; 
<i>(r,g,b)</i> gives the color of the light, and
<i>(dx,dy,dz)</i> is a vector describing the direction of the 
light (it will be normalized by the parser).  Since directional light sources do not attenuate with distance,
<i>ca</i>, <i>la</i>, and <i>qa</i> are not parameters of this command. 
</p><p>If no light sources
appear in the file, default ones will be provided by the parser (two directional
light sources).  Otherwise, every light source must 
appear before any <i>begin</i> commands in the file.  

<br>&nbsp;<br></p><hr>
<p><b>point_light</b> 
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; r g b</b> 
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; px py pz</b> 
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ca la qa</b> 
</p><p>This command defines a point light source in the scene. 
<i>(r,g,b)</i> gives the color of the light. 
<i>(px,py,pz) </i>gives the position of the light in world coordinates. 
</p><p>The attenuation of the light with distance from its position is given by <i>ca, 
la, </i>and <i>qa </i>which define the constant, linear and quadratic components 
of the attenuation factor. If <i>d</i> is the distance from the light to 
the surface, then the light's color at the surface is given by (<i>r,g,b</i>) 
*<i>1.0/</i> (<i>ca </i>+ <i>la*d</i> + <i>qa*d*d</i>). Each coeficient 
must be non-negative. Note: to achieve no attenuation use a 
<i>(ca,la,qa)</i> of (<i>1.0,0.0,0.0</i>). 
</p><p>If no light sources
appear in the file, default ones will be provided by the parser (two directional
light sources).  Otherwise, every light source must 
appear before any <i>begin</i> commands in the file.

<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dx dy dz</b> 
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ca la qa</b> 
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sc sd</b> 
</p><p>This command defines a spot light in the scene. 
<i>(r,g,b)</i> gives the color of the light, and <i>(px,py,pz)</i>
gives the position of the light in world coordinates. 
In this ray tracer, use this single light color for diffuse 
and specular contributions at each surface. Do not compute ambient 
contributions from each light, but rather use the global ambient light defined 
by the <i>ambient</i> command. 
</p><p>The attenuation of the light with distance from its position is given by <i>ca, 
la, </i>and <i>qa </i>which define the constant, linear and quadratic components 
of the attenuation factor. If <i>d</i> is the distance from the light to 
the surface, then the light's color at the surface is given by (<i>r,g,b</i>) 
*<i>1.0/</i> (<i>ca </i>+ <i>la*d</i> + <i>qa*d*d</i>). Each coeficient 
must be non-negative. Note: to achieve no attenuation use a 
<i>(ca,la,qa)</i> of (<i>1.0,0.0,0.0</i>). 
</p><p>The direction of the spot light source is given by (dx,dy,dz), and 
the cutoff angle is given by <i>sc</i> -- i.e., the half angle of 
divergence of the light cone. It can be measured as the angle from the 
center axis (dx,dy,dz) to the edge of the spot cone (in radians). 
The fall off in intensity from the center axis to the 
cone edge is given by the spot drop-off exponent, <i>sd</i>. 
So, for a given direction, L, whose angle to the center axis (dx,dy,dz)
is less than sc, the light intensity (before attenuation with distance)
can be computed by cos(angle)^sd, or equivalently (L dot (dx,dy,dz))^sd. 
Note that sc should be less than <i>pi/2</i> radians,
and sd can take any non-negative, where <i>0.0</i> indicated constant 
intensity across the cone, and <i>100.0</i> yields a sharp fall-off.
</p><p>If no light sources
appear in the file, default ones will be provided by the parser (two directional
light sources).  Otherwise, every light source must 
appear before any <i>begin</i> commands in the file.  


<br>&nbsp;<br></p><hr>
<p><b>background</b> 
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; r g b</b>
</p><p>This command defines the background color for the scene.  For a 
ray tracer, it specifies the RGB color that should be used for rays that
fail to intersect any object. The <i>r</i>, <i>g</i>, and
<i>b</i> values range from 0 to 1 (where 0,0,0 is black
and 1,1,1 is white).  The <i>background</i> command is not required --
a default background (black) will be computed if none is present in
the file.  If there is a <i>background</i> command, it must appear
before of any <i>begin</i> commands.  Also, if there are more than one
<i>background</i> commands in the file, the last is used, and the
others are ignored.

</p><p>This command defines a perspective camera in the scene. <i>(eye_x,eye_y,eye_z)</i> is the 
position of the camera in world coordinates, <i>(towards_x,towards_y,towards_z)</i> is a vector 
describing the direction the camera is pointing, and <i>(up_x,up_y,up_z)</i> is a vector in the 
up direction. The half-width angle of the viewing frustum is given by 
<i>xfov</i>, and the half-height angle is set based on the image aspect ratio
according to <i>yfov = atan(tan(xfov)*height/width)</i>, 
where <i>width</i> and <i>height</i> are the width and height of the output image (given on 
the command line in raypro or the size of the window in rayview). 

</p><p>The <i>camera</i> command is not required -- a default camera will be computed
if none is present in the file.  If there is a <i>camera</i> command, 
it must appear before of any <i>begin</i> commands.   Also, if there
are more than one <i>camera</i> commands in the file, the last is used, 
and the others are ignored.

<p><b>include &nbsp; scenefile</b> 
</p><p> This command includes the scene defined by the specified file into
the current scene.  Specifically, the scene graph constructed while parsing 
<i>scenefile</i> will be added to the current scene graph as a subtree rooted
at the current parsing position.  So, this command can occur anywhere in 
the scene file, and transformations of the scene graph hierarchy will affect
included geometry in the same way that it would if the commands were copied
into the file at the same location.  Yet, materials defined in <i>scenefile</i> 
will not affect the indices to be used for materials in the current file.
